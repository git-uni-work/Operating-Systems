# " IMAGE CONVOLUTION "

Cache access optimization
==============================================

#### Introduction 

You are an employee of an IT firm and you are a member of a team that
develops an image editor (Photoshop, Gimp …​). In order to gain
customers, the editor must be sufficiently fast and easy to use,
otherwise it will lose against its competition. You were assigned the
task to implement the
[convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) operation into
the core of the program. Convolution is one of the most important
operations when processing digital images. In a nutshell, it computes
resulting pixels as weighted sums of their neighboring pixels. The
computation is done for each color component separately. Your next task
is to compute the histogram.\

How convolution works, see here:
[http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)

#### Task

Your homework will be to implement only the below mentioned convolution
mask for image sharpening, while optimizing the memory accesses in
whatever way is needed – focus on efficient use of cache when using this
particular mask.

  ---- ---- ----
  0    -1   0
  -1   5    -1
  0    -1   0
  ---- ---- ----

**If a value lies outside the limits of the interval \<0, 255\>, use the
appropriate limit.** The pixels on the image’s edges shall be only
copied from the original image (the situation where the convolution core
overruns the original image).

Furthermore, compute and write into a file the histogram of the focused
image in shades of grey. For the conversion from RGB to grayscale, use
the luminance model:\
 Y = round(0.2126\*R + 0.7152\*G + 0.0722\*B)\

The histogram shall be computed for left-closed, right-open intervals
(bins) \< i\*L/N; (i+1)\*L/N ) except the last bin, which is also
right-closed; for i=0…​N-1, where L=255 and N=5 is the number of bins.
In other words, divide the interval \<0; 255\> into the following bins:

  -------- --------- ----------- ------------ ------------ ------------
  Bin:     0 to 50   51 to 101   102 to 152   153 to 203   204 to 255
  Count:                                                   
  -------- --------- ----------- ------------ ------------ ------------

#### Input data 

The input image will be in the binary encoded [portable pixmap format
(PPM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format). An image in this
format always begins with P6, followed by the image width and height.
Next, the constant 255 (maximum intensity of a given pixel component),
followed by the main image data - individual RGB components for each
pixel. Every pixel component (R, G, B) occupies one byte.

[vit-small.zip]
[vit-normal.zip]

**The input image file name will be passed on the command line** – see
the parameters of the main function: main(int argc, char \* \*argv).

#### Output of the program 

Output of your program will be the focused image in the file named
**output.ppm**, and the histogram (luminance counts separated by spaces)
in the file **output.txt**.

#### Evaluation criteria 

Your program will be evaluated by the total accesses of data L1,
instruction L1, shared L2 caches, and foremost, by the number of misses
in L1 data, instruction and L2 cache levels. Assume separated L1
instruction and data caches, 32 KB each, 8-way set associative, block
size 64B. **Shared L2 cache is 1MB, 16-way set associative, block size
64B.** Replacement strategy is LRU. L2 cache is inclusive (meaning, the
contents of L1 caches are also contained in the L2 cache). Your program
should be able to detect these parameters and adapt to them, however,
for the sake of this homework, it is fully sufficient to optimize your
program just for the aforementioned values.

**Scoring:**

-   5 points for this homework is for a functioning program
    (pts\_function)
-   further points will be awarded according to the efficiency of cache
    usage, provided and only if the program is functioning
    (pts\_efficiency)
-   **Total point score for this homework: Points = pts\_function +
    pts\_efficiency**

Efficiency of cache usage will be evaluated based on the performance of
your program.\

Cost = AMAT\_i\*I\_refs + AMAT\_d\*D\_refs, \

where

-   AMAT\_i is the average memory access time for instruction cache
    requests: AMAT\_i = HT\_L1i + MR\_L1i\*(HT\_L2 + MR\_L2i\*HT\_RAM)
-   I\_refs is the number of references to instruction cache
-   AMAT\_d = HT\_L1d + MR\_L1d\*(HT\_L2 + MR\_L2d\*HT\_RAM)
-   D\_refs the number of references to data cache
-   Assumed CPU clock frequency: 3.2 GHz
-   Latency of L1: 4 cycles ⇒ HT\_L1i = HT\_L1d = 1.25 ns
-   Latency of L2: 65 cycles ⇒ HT\_L2 = 20.3 ns
-   Latency of RAM: 140 cycles + 100 ns ⇒ HT\_RAM = 144 ns

Consequently, the points for efficiency will be determined by the
equation: \

pts\_efficiency = 10\*(Cost\_Max - Cost)/(Cost\_Max - Cost\_Min),\

where\
 **Cost\_Min = 2.0\
 Cost\_Max = 9.0**.

Any negative point score will be truncated to 0 points for efficiency.
Any score exceeding 10 points will be truncated to 10 points. Point
score will be rounded up to a multiple of 0.25. Your program will be
tested with several different image files (with varying sizes). **The
values of Cost\_Min = 2.0 and Cost\_Max = 9.0 apply to images of the
size of vit\_normal.ppm, 64-bit Ubuntu, gcc 4.8.4.**

Total maximum point score for this project is 15 points.


###### Tip: {.block-title .label-only}

Compilation – C:

`gcc -O1 -Wall -Werror -std=c99 -lm -o main main.c`

###### Tip: {.block-title .label-only}

Compilation – C++:

`g++ -O1 -Wall -Werror -lm -o main main.cpp`

All submitted solutions will be checked for plagiarism (all affected
people will be punished without discrimination).

**Caution:** The file output.txt must contain exactly 5 decimal numbers
separated by single spaces. The last number must not be followed by
anything (not even a newline).

#### Hint

The Cost used to evaluate your solution is directly coupled to the
program’s execution speed (faster program means lower cost). Measuring
run time is an easy way to assess the efficiency of your approach from
both the memory access and algorithmic aspects. You can measure run time
the following way:

    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <time.h>
    ...
    struct timespec start, stop;
    clock_gettime( CLOCK_REALTIME, &start);
    ...
    clock_gettime( CLOCK_REALTIME, &stop);
    double accum = ( stop.tv_sec - start.tv_sec )*1000.0 + ( stop.tv_nsec - start.tv_nsec )/ 1000000.0;
    printf( "Time: %.6lf ms\n", accum );

Note: When compiling, do not forget -lrt. Example: g + + main.cpp -g
-lrt

To evaluate the program’s cache utilization, you can use cachegrind. Do
not forget to set the cache parameters (–I1=…​ –D1=…​ –LL=…​), or else
some default values will be used (or your processor’s values).

    valgrind --tool=cachegrind --I1=32768,8,64 --D1=32768,8,64 --LL=1048576,16,64 ./a.out

This way you can get an idea about the overall behavior of your program.
If you want to analyze the program deeper, you can use the cg\_annotate
tool. Example:

    cg_annotate <filename> ~/homework/main.cpp

where filename is the file generated by cachegrind. Use the absolute
path to your source file (main.cpp).


###### Important: {.block-title .label-only}

For vit\_small.ppm, the otput file md5 sum is
32554ccd9b09af5b660a17b05350959b. The header of the output file is the
same as the header of the input file – a whitespace used to separate
individual items of the header is \\n. Histogram starts with: 24432,
16307, 15192. Next two numbers are not shown here.
